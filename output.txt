Reggie's father Saul was serving at the American Air Force base in Aviano, Italy. The Jackson family then briefly moved to England before returning to the United States when Reggie was five. The Jackson family then lived in North Dakota, Georgia and Florida before deciding on Colorado. Jackson graduated from General William J. Palmer HS in Colorado Springs, where the guard was named the 2007-08 Gatorade Colorado Boys' Basketball Player of the Year. Jackson is the leader of the Reggie Jackson DETermined to Assist Foundation, which has opened several literacy lounges at various schools throughout Detroit. The foundation's mission is to impact the lives of low-income children in Detroit by providing educational opportunities and resources that they otherwise wouldn't have access to. Follow Jackson on Twitter and Instagram (@Reggie_Jackson). Jackson's role with Boston College grew in each of his three seasons in Chestnut Hill. As a freshman, he came off the bench in support of Tyrese Rice. The 6-foot-3 guard provided 7.0 points and 1.7 assists in 20.0 minutes per game, and the Eagles advanced to the NCAA Tournament. In the first-round loss to USC, Jackson provided four points, four rebounds, four assists, and three steals. Jackson started 20 games as a sophomore and pushed his production to 12.9 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The Eagles struggled to 6-10 in the ACC in coach Al Skinner's last season on the sideline. As a junior, new coach Steve Donahue gave Jackson the keys to the offense and the guard took full advantage. He put up 18.2 points 4.5 assists and 4.3 rebounds per contest. Jackson reached the 30-point plateau twice, including scoring a career-high 31 in a win over Maryland. He led the Eagles to the NIT, where they beat McNeese State behind 22 points from Jackson. The guard declared for the 2011 NBA Draft after his junior season and was drafted 24th overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder.\u003c/div\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n ","gameLogs":[{"SEASON_ID":"22023","Player_ID":202704,"Game_ID":"0022300539","GAME_DATE":"JAN 12, 2024","MATCHUP":"DEN vs. NOP","WL":"W","MIN":24,"FGM":5,"FGA":10,"FG_PCT":0.5,"FG3M":2,"FG3A":5,"FG3_PCT":0.4,"FTM":0,"FTA":0,"FT_PCT":0,"OREB":0,"DREB":2,"REB":2,"AST":0,"STL":1,"BLK":0,"TOV":3,"PF":1,"PTS":12,"PLUS_MINUS":4,"VIDEO_AVAILABLE":1,"GAME_STATUS":3},{"SEASON_ID":"22023","Player_ID":202704,"Game_ID":"0022300524","GAME_DATE":"JAN 10, 2024","MATCHUP":"DEN @ UTA","WL":"L","MIN":20,"FGM":2,"FGA":7,"FG_PCT":0.286,"FG3M":1,"FG3A":4,"FG3_PCT":0.25,"FTM":0,"FTA":0,"FT_PCT":0,"OREB":0,"DREB":0,"REB":0,"AST":2,"STL":0,"BLK":0,"TOV":0,"PF":2,"PTS":5,"PLUS_MINUS":3,"VIDEO_AVAILABLE":1,"GAME_STATUS":3},{"SEASON_ID":"22023","Player_ID":202704,"Game_ID":"0022300502","GAME_DATE":"JAN 07, 2024","MATCHUP":"DEN vs. DET","WL":"W","MIN":21,"FGM":5,"FGA":7,"FG_PCT":0.714,"FG3M":1,"FG3A":1,"FG3_PCT":1,"FTM":2,"FTA":2,"FT_PCT":1,"OREB":2,"DREB":1,"REB":3,"AST":9,"STL":1,"BLK":0,"TOV":1,"PF":5,"PTS":13,"PLUS_MINUS":14,"VIDEO_AVAILABLE":1,"GAME_STATUS":3},{"SEASON_ID":"22023","Player_ID":202704,"Game_ID":"0022300488","GAME_DATE":"JAN 05, 2024","MATCHUP":"DEN vs. ORL","WL":"L","MIN":17,"FGM":5,"FGA":12,"FG_PCT":0.417,"FG3M":1,"FG3A":5,"FG3_PCT":0.2,"FTM":0,"FTA":0,"FT_PCT":0,"OREB":1,"DREB":2,"REB":3,"AST":3,"STL":0,"BLK":0,"TOV":1,"PF":0,"PTS":11,"PLUS_MINUS":1,"VIDEO_AVAILABLE":1,"GAME_STATUS":3},{"SEASON_ID":"22023","Player_ID":202704,"Game_ID":"0022300478","GAME_DATE":"JAN 04, 2024","MATCHUP":"DEN @ GSW","WL":"W","MIN":16,"FGM":1,"FGA":6,"FG_PCT":0.167,"FG3M":0,"FG3A":0,"FG3_PCT":0,"FTM":0,"FTA":0,"FT_PCT":0,"OREB":0,"DREB":0,"REB":0,"AST":3,"STL":0,"BLK":0,"TOV":1,"PF":0,"PTS":2,"PLUS_MINUS":-6,"VIDEO_AVAILABLE":1,"GAME_STATUS":3}],"awards":[{"name":"NBA Player of the Week","count":2}],"latestVideos":[{"id":1049361,"type":"video","name":"road-to-gold-the-hometown-kid","title":"Road to Gold: The Hometown Kid","status":"publish","slug":"road-to-gold-the-hometown-kid","permalink":"https://www.nba.com/nuggets/videos/road-to-gold-the-hometown-kid","excerpt":"The newest episode of Road to Gold features Colorado's own, Reggie Jackson.
